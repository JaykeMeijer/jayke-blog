Hi, my name is Jayke Meijer. I'm a software engineer, data engineer, computer & network security geek and
hobby-grade electronics nerd from The Netherlands.

When I am not doing computer stuff, I enjoy (working on) classic cars and doing outdoor, adrenaline inducing sports like
mountainbiking and skiing. The latter I enjoy doing as a teacher and trainer too, spending time in the Tyrolian alps as
instructor.
