I figured it was time to

1. do something with the jayke.nl domain that I've had for a long time
2. play around with some static site generation tooling and
3. create a place where I can jot down some of my thoughts, or indulge in shameless self-promotion over some of the
  hobby projects I have done.

Let's see what comes of this. I'll figure out over time whether I have anything relevant to share. To be determined. I
promise to keep it politics-free, probably.
